    <h2>Why Clean-Up Matters</h2>
    <p>Cleaning public spaces improves health, safety, and local pride.</p>


    <b>1. Our Mission</b>
    <p>We aim to build cleaner, healthier, and more sustainable neighborhoods by connecting passionate volunteers with community cleanup opportunities.</p>
    <b>2. Who We Are</b>
    <p>We are a team of citizens committed to civic responsibility, environmental stewardship, and social change through hands-on community service.</p>
    <b>3. Why We Started</b>
    <ol>
    <p>We noticed growing waste and neglect in public spaces and realized that change begins with us.</p> 
      <p>This platform was born out of a desire to mobilize everyday people to take action.</p>
      </ol>
    <b>4. What We Do</b>
    <p>We organize and support cleanup drives in residential colonies, parks, streets, and neglected public areas—empowering volunteers to restore beauty and hygiene to their surroundings.</p>
    <b>5. Our Vision</b>
    <p>A future where every community takes pride in its environment, and volunteers feel empowered to make a tangible difference in their local areas.</p>
    <b>6. How It Works</b>
<p>Volunteers can sign up for local cleanup events, track upcoming drives, and even organize their own with the help of our platform and network.
</p>
<b>7. Impact-Driven Approach</b>
<p>We focus on visible results—from cleaner streets to greener parks—and share our success stories to inspire more participation and civic awareness.
</p>
<b>8. Inclusive and Open to All</b>
<p>Whether you're a student, working professional, or retiree—everyone is welcome to join and contribute their time and energy to a cleaner tomorrow.
</p>
<b>9. Collaboration with Communities</b>
<p>We work closely with Resident Welfare Associations (RWAs), local municipalities, schools, and social groups to ensure our efforts are community-centric and sustainable.
</p>
<b>10. More Than Cleanup</b>
<p>Our goal goes beyond just cleaning. We educate citizens on waste segregation, plastic reduction, recycling, and long-term behavioral change for a cleaner future.</p>
